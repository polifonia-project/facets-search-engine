# Structure of the data indexed by Facets

Facets is centered on music content codified according to the principles of music notation, and annotated with metadata. The central notion is an *Opus*. An opus is essentially:

  - a music document from which codified music content can be extracted ; typically a MEI document containing a codified music score.
  - a set of meta-data that qualify the opus: a composer, a genre, an instrumentation, a period, etc. 
  
 At first glance, an Opus might be considered as equivalent to a music score encoded in a codified language. It is howerver at the same time more and less than that.
 
   - more : annotations can be added to the music content (for instance harmony, texture, timbre). Such annotations are distinct from the opus-level annotations: they qualify the music  at a specific musical timestamp.
